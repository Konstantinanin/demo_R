# demo_R

This is a semester essay completed with the use of R. The topic is linguistics-centered and includes data that have been previously collected from the web
and annotated using the UAM Corpus Tool. The xml files were introduced into R, the data was cleaned and a dataframe was created. There is also some linguistic
theory (in Greek) on which our hypothesis is based. There are two variants of a greek diphtong, which are related to formal and informal contexts respectively according to the theory. The spoken and written corpora are considered informal and formal respectively. The zero hypothesis is that the occurence of both diphthongs will be the same for both corpora. After preprocessing our corpora we perform some exploratory data analysis, visualizing them and then we implement some statistical analysis. The results show that there is a tendency for the formal variant to be more prominent in formal contexts (written corpus), whereas the informal one in informal contexts (spoken corpus).
